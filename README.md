# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview:

This project uses python and machine learning libraries to evaluate models that work with a credit card dataset that was given. We use the following models in our evalutation:
Oversampling - using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
Undersampling - using the ClusterCentroids algorithm
Conbinational - using BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier

## Results: Explain the purpose of this analysis.



Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary:


Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
